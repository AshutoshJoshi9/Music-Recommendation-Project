# Music-Recommendation-Project

## Hello!:wave: I created a Music Recommendation System:musical_note: with Python and the Spotify API. 

This system, rooted in Data Science, is designed to help users discover new and fitting musical content by analyzing their preferences and listening patterns. 
To achieve this, I employed the SciKitLearn library to implement the Cosine Similarity algorithm.
* Music Recommendation Systems function through sophisticated algorithms that examine extensive datasets related to users' musical interactions.
* This includes their listening history, favored tracks, skipped songs, and even explicit user preferences expressed through ratings or feedback. 
* These data elements play a crucial role in building comprehensive user profiles, outlining individual tastes and preferences.
