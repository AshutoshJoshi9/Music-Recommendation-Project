# Music-Recommendation-Project

I created a Music Recommendation System with Python and the Spotify API. 
This system, rooted in Data Science, is designed to help users discover new and fitting musical content by analyzing their preferences and listening patterns. 
To achieve this, I employed the SciKitLearn library to implement the Cosine Similarity algorithm.
